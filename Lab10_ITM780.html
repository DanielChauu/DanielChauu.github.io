<h3> Search Engine Optimization</h3>
<p> The three search engine optimization techniques that I found most interesting and potentially useful were mobile optimization, meta description, and high-quality backlinks. Mobile optimization ensures a website provides an amazing experience on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It involves adjusting the website design, and features to ensure usability and accessibility on a smaller screen. I think this is a useful feature because many users nowadays are on their mobile phone while accessing websites. So if your website is not mobile friendly, you are potentially losing a large amount of audience looking at your website. Meta description is a brief HTML attribute that provides a short summary of a webpage’s content. I think it's a useful technique because it can increase click-through rates by providing users with a clear and engaging summary of a webpage’s content, helping users decide to visit the page. High-quality backlinks are links from reputable, authoritative websites that direct users to your website. I think this a useful feature because it helps improve search rankings, drive referral traffic, and enhance your site’s credibility allowing more users to trust what they are clicking and viewing on.

<h3>Social Media Optimization </h3>
<p> The three social media optimization tools that I found most interesting and potentially useful were optimizing social media profiles, using hashtags, and using social sharing features. Having a fully functional social media profile can allow a strong and professional brand precisely on platforms such as Instagram, LinkedIn and X. I think this is a useful tool because an optimized profile allows you to build trust with your audience and can make your brand look discoverable more easily. Implementing trending and relevant hashtags in your post can boost your discoverability on platforms such as instagram and X. Hashtags categorize your content to make it accessible to users searching for or somewhat those tags. I think this is a useful tool because it can help expand your reach to instant followers and can attract new, to build a new audience. Adding social sharing buttons to your website can be an effective way to allow users to share your content across different platforms. This can increase the visibility of your content as users share it. I think this tool is useful because it's a great way to promote your website or platform without spending money on it.
